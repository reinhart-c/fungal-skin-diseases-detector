# Fungal Skin Diseases Detector
Made for Intel for Youth (2019) program. An AI to detect and classify fungal skin infection from images.


# Skills and Tools
- Python
- NumPy
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV


# Problem
Most of the people living in Indonesia don’t really care  about the environmental condition in their area. Moreover, Indonesia is a tropical country. Therefore, fungal infection spreads easily. If it’s not treated immediately, it can cause a lot of health problems, some could also cause death.

Even though some of them can be deadly, people often ignore them and let them heal by itself. Fungal infection itself is a very common problem in Indonesia. By the 2010 Indonesian Health Profile, skin diseases are the 3rd most common disease based on the number of patients that came to the hospital.


# Solution
With our AI program, you can detect fungal infections when you feels like encountering one, and then treat it immediately to prevent it from becoming worse. This can lower the case of severe illness because of fungal infection.


# Method
At first, we searched about topics that are problems in our lives but are often ignored, that’s why we came up with the fungal infection problem. After that, we type the code and collect databases from the internet, then the third step is to separate them into groups based on the classification. Then we use that models to train our program numerous times to improve the accuracy of our code. That’s how our “Fungal Skin Diseases Detector” was made.
